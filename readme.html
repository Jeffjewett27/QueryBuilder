                **Project: QueryBuilder**

This is the report of our progress so far in developing a domain specific language known as QueryBuilder.


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Introduction
================

QueryBuilder is a DSL for composing and executing regex statements

regex is confusing, the DSL seeks to simplify it and allow for testing

useful to write complex regex queries quickly

solves the problem of capture groups not being very robust

Features
================

labels for repeated inputs

simplified common expressions

distinguish between capture groups (format output accordingly)

compile to regex

template functions

test regex against input data (STDIN | INPUT FILE)

Examples
================

File 1: example.qb

```
namespace example

label capture firstname = "[a-zA-z]+"
label capture[] lastname = "[a-zA-z]+"
label fullname = firstname "\s" lastname

function fencepost(x,y) = x "(?>" y x ")*"
label namelist = fencepost(fullname, ",\s")

build [flags] output = namelist  #build regex form
test output @STDIN
test output 'inputfile.txt'
```

File 2: test.qb

```
import previousfile.qb
namespace test

label capture[] email = "[\w\.]*@\w*.\w*"
label emaillist = example.fencepost(email, ",\s")
build output = emaillist
```

Process
================

namelist

fencepost(fullname,",\s")

fullname(,",\s"fullname)*

firstname"\s"lastname"(?>,\s"firstname"\s"lastname)*

(firstname)"\s"(lastname)"(?>,\s"(firstname)"\s"(lastname))*

([a-zA-z]+)\s([a-zA-z]+)(?>,\s([a-zA-z]+)\s([a-zA-z]+))*

Test
================

input 1
--------------------------------

Joe Smith, Debra Jones

Jeff Jewett, Owen Elliott

output 1
--------------------------------

Match 1: Joe Smith, Debra Jones

Group 1: Joe

Group lastname1: Smith

Group 3: Debra

Group lastname2: Jones


Match 2: Jeff Jewett, Owen Elliott

Match 1: Joe Smith, Debra Jones

Group 1: Jeff

Group lastname1: Jewett

Group 3: Owen

Group lastname2: Elliott


input 2
--------------------------------

owenelliott64@gmail.com, jeffiscool@example.com

output 2
--------------------------------

Match 1: owenelliott64@gmail.com, jeffiscool@example.com

Group email1: owenelliott64@gmail.com

Group email2: jeffiscool@example.com


Grammar
================

import: appends following file to the top of the script, generates symbol table (like a #include)

label: a named pattern of regex literals or function outputs that can be referenced later, added to the symbol table

capture: a modifier to a label that indicates that it is a capture group (can also name capture groups in a list)

function: a template pattern with placeholder values

build: translates the following pattern into proper regex. can be modified with flags.

test: given a built query and a target, search the target using the given query.

namespace: delcare the title of this file's labels / functions, if included in another file reference with namespace.label


Parser
================

QueryBuilder files are recognized as valid input using the ANTLR grammar system. We ran tests to see if the parser could tell the difference between valid and invalid syntax, and it passed all ten tests.
All ten tests used are in the /test/ subdirectory.

![Parse Tree](asset1.png)

Here are a few sample tests for valid input

test6

```
import './test.qb'
#import the file

label ex = 'ex'
label mod = '?'

function concat (a,b) = a b
#the parser accepts this input
```

test5

```
import 'test.qb'
namespace example

label new = test.foo test.bar('a')
build out = test.prebuilt @GM
test out @STDIN
#the parser accepts this input
```

Here are a few sample tests for invalid input

test 3

```
namespace bad3

label nothingWrongSoFar = 'ok'

build forgotAnEquals nothingWrongSoFar
#the parser rejects this input
```

test 4

```
namespace bad4

label missingQuotes = $hello^

build output = missingQuotes
#the parser rejects this input
```



Translator
==================

We used the ANTLR listener classes as a tool to build a translator for QueryBuilder. We accomplished our goal of making a language that is easy to write in while being functional.

The best way to explain it is to show a few examples. The following QueryBuilder program is an example of the proper way to utilize the language.

```
# declare the namespace
# (optional unless you import this file into a different file)
namespace example

capture firstname = "[a-zA-z]+"
capture[] lastname = "[a-zA-z]+"
label fullname = firstname "\s" lastname

function fencepost(x,y) = x "(" y x ")*"
label namelist = fencepost(fullname, ",\s?")

# build regex form
build output = namelist

# test against STDIN
test output @STDIN
```

![Result (from STDIN)](result1.png)

As you can see, the compiled regex statement successfully matched the user input string. You can also match a different file by replacing `test output @STDIN` with something like `test output 'test/inputfile.txt'`

![Result (from file)](result2.png)

Here are a few of the situations where our translator will catch semantic errors in the code. We created a SymbolTable class that stores all the named labels, functions, builds, etc. and used it to make sure the code doesn't try to declare
more than one of these with the same identifier. The following code tries to declare two labels with the same name:

```
label example = "[^abc]"
label example = "[^def]"

build output = example
test output @STDIN
```

The process ends with the message `Cannot overwrite an existing label or function name: example`.

The previous example also did not have a namespace declared. While that is legal, it would cause a problem if a different program imported it, as its symbols are referenced by that name.

The error message `Imported files must have a namespace: test/testFile1.qb` would appear if testFile1 was about to be imported and it didn't have a declared namespace.

Similarly, if you try to import a file that doesn't exist, the program will halt with the error message `Could not open file filename.txt`.

Another feature of QueryBuilder is the concept of namespaces. By importing other files, their symbols are accessed with the syntax `namespace.symbol`. For example, take a look at the following program.

```
import "test/good4.qb"

label test1 = aNameSpace.ftest

build output = test1
test output @STDIN
```
And this is what `good4.qb` has:

```
namespace aNameSpace

label ex = 'ex'

function concat (a,b) = a "(?>" b a ")*"

label ftest = concat('g', 'h')

build out = ftest
```
