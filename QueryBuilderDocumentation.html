Please refer to this documentation when using the QueryBuilder language.


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.


Submission
-----------


Create a zip file that contains all of your code, this `readme.html` document, and any additional files of evidence (ex: screenshots).

Use folders to divide up the subparts of your submission.
For example, your zip file could look like the following:

~~~~
readme.html
ada/
primepartitions.adb
screenshot.png
go/
primepartitions.go
screenshot.png
haskell/
primepartitions.hs

Introduction
================

QueryBuilder is a DSL for composing and executing regex statements.

Regex is confusing, so QueryBuilder seeks to simplify it and allow for testing.

QueryBuilder is useful to write complex regex queries quickly.

Keywords
================

label
-----------

`label` is a type given to variables that store valid regex.

Examples: `label word = "[a-zA-Z]+"` `label twoWords = word "\s" word`

namespace
-----------

`namespace` is a name given to the file which is used to reference the labels and funcitons in this file if it is imported into another file.

`namespace` is technically optional, but if you try and import a file with no declared namespace then there will be no way to access the labels and
functions in the imported file.

`namespace` must go after any import statements but before any other statements.

Example: `namespace test`

import
-----------

`import` is a way to include other files when using QueryBuilder.

See the above section for `namespace` on how to reference an imported file.

`import` statements must go before any other statements.

`import` will throw an error if the filename after it is invalid.

Example: `import "test.qb"`

function
-----------

`function` is used to define a regex pattern that should be applied to the given parameters.

`function` parameters should not be empty. Use labels instead.

Examples: `function makeList(a) = a "(?> ,\s?" a ")*"` `function repeat3(a,b,c) = a b c`

capture
-----------

`capture` is used in place of `label` when you want a certain label to always be captured.

`capture` automatically adds a named cpature group to the stored expression (the variable name is used for this name).

`capture[]` can instead be used if you want to see the number of each group when using `test`.

Example: `capture fullName = firstName "\s" lastName` `capture[] numberedFoo = "foo"`

build
-----------

`build` generates a full regex expression given a label or capture group.

Use in combination with `test` to see the output of the built expression.

Example: `build output = fullName `

test
-----------

`test` will test the given built expression against the given input.

The first parameter after `test` should be any built expression.

The second parameter should be either a text file to read input from or `@STDIN` to read from standard input instead.

The third parameter is optional, and it is the name of a file to save the json output to.

Examples: `test output @STDIN` `test output 'inputFile.txt' 'output.json'`

Comments
================

Using a # character at the start of a line will cause that line to be a comment.

Comments are purely for the user, as the complier will ignore any line starting with a # character.

Examples
================

File 1: fullnameList.qb

```
namespace fn

label firstname = "[a-zA-z]+"
label lastname = "[a-zA-z]+"
capture fullname = firstname "\s" lastname

function fencepost(x,y) = x "(?>" y x ")*"
label namelist = fencepost(fullname, ",\s")

build output = namelist  #build regex form
```

File 2: mailingList.qb

```
import "fullnameList.qb"
namespace test

capture[] email = "[\w\.]*@\w*.\w*"
label emailList = fn.fencepost(email, ",\s")
build output = emailList

test fn.output @STDIN
test output 'mailingList.txt' 'mailingListOuptut.json'
```
